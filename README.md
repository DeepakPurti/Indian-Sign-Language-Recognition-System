# Indian-Sign-Language-Recognition-System
A system for recognition of alphabets and digits of Indian Sign Language (ISL) using computer vision techniques and deep learning.

The original repository is for gestures of American Sign Language (ASL). The primary difference between both languages is that,  
while in ASL all alphabets and digits are made using one hand only, in ISL most of them are made using both hands.
